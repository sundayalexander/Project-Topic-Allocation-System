## ABSTRACT:
This study addresses inefficiencies in the manual allocation of undergraduate students to project topics in Adekunle Ajasin University, which often result in mismatches between students’ research interests and supervisors’ expertise. It proposes a Genetic Programming (GP)-based model for optimizing the allocation of project topics to students based on research domains and preference criteria. 
The Student-to-Project Topic Allocation (SPA) problem was formulated as a constrained optimization model incorporating supervisors’ capacity, including experience, and student preference matrices. A soft computing approach, primarily Genetic Algorithms, was adopted, and we implemented the system using PHP, MySQL, and Agile feature-driven development. Genetic operators, including selection, crossover, natural selection, and mutation, were implemented to generate optimal allocations. 
The system was evaluated through unit, integration, and system testing. Results indicate that the GP model achieved an allocation optimality of 75.86%, outperforming traditional manual methods. The study demonstrates that genetic programming provides a robust, scalable, and effective solution for equitable and interest-aligned undergraduate project allocation.
